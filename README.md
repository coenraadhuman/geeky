### Linux Distros

- [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/): a very polished Ubuntu based distro, which includes a lot of enhancements, great graphic card hardware support and power management.
- [Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core): for IoT and embedded environments, optimised for security and reliable ota updates. Great for running containers on a low powered device such as a NUC.
